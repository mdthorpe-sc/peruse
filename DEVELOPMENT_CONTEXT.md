# Development Context & Session History

*This file preserves context across development sessions for AI assistant continuity*

## 📋 Project Overview

**Screenshot Monitoring Tool** - A Python application for taking website screenshots and using AI-powered change detection via Amazon Bedrock for deployment monitoring and site availability checks.

### Core Components
- `screenshot_tool.py` - Simple screenshot capture tool
- `screenshot_monitor.py` - Advanced monitoring with AI comparison (25KB, 623 lines)
- `models.json` - Configurable Claude model definitions
- `test_setup.py` - Setup verification tool
- `OPTIMIZATIONS.md` - Comprehensive optimization roadmap

## 🎯 Current State (January 2024)

### ✅ **Completed Work**

#### 1. **Critical Bug Fix** ✅ *COMPLETED*
- **Issue**: Bedrock client initialization was unreachable (after return statement)
- **Impact**: AI comparison functionality completely broken
- **Fix**: Moved client initialization from `load_model_config()` to `__init__()` method
- **Verification**: Error changed from AttributeError to credential error (expected)
- **Files Modified**: `screenshot_monitor.py`, `OPTIMIZATIONS.md`

#### 2. **JSON-Based Model Configuration** ✅ *COMPLETED*
- **Achievement**: Externalized model configuration from hardcoded Python to `models.json`
- **Benefits**: Easy maintenance, user customization, runtime updates
- **Features**: 6 Claude models, metadata (speed/cost/quality), configurable defaults
- **Default Model**: `claude-4-sonnet`

#### 3. **Comprehensive Tool Suite** ✅ *COMPLETED*
- Basic screenshot tool with Playwright
- Advanced monitoring with baseline storage
- AI-powered change detection using Claude models
- Automatic fallback (inference profile → direct model)
- Rich reporting with severity levels and recommendations

### 🔧 **Architecture Decisions Made**

1. **Model Selection Strategy**: Inference profiles preferred, direct models as fallback
2. **Configuration Pattern**: External JSON files for all configurable options
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages  
4. **File Organization**: Separate tools for different use cases
5. **CLI Design**: Subcommands (baseline, compare, list, list-models)

### 🚨 **Known Issues & Limitations**

1. **Memory Usage**: Large images loaded entirely into memory during comparison
2. **No Caching**: Model config and metadata re-read on every operation
3. **Large Methods**: `compare_with_claude()` and `generate_report()` are 100-200+ lines
4. **Code Duplication**: Screenshot logic duplicated between tools
5. **Resource Management**: No cleanup of failed screenshots, potential browser leaks

## 📊 **Optimization Roadmap Status**

*From OPTIMIZATIONS.md - 12 categories, 15 total optimizations remaining*

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes** 
- [x] Fix Bedrock client initialization ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Cache model configuration in memory ✅ **COMPLETED & MERGED** (6.2x improvement)
- [ ] Add basic input validation
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### **High Impact, Low Effort (Next Priority)**
1. **Extract screenshot logic to shared module** (1 hour)  
2. **Add proper logging framework** (1 hour)
3. **Implement image streaming for large files** (4 hours)

### **High Impact, Medium Effort**
4. **Implement image streaming for large files** (4 hours)
5. **Add browser connection pooling** (3 hours)
6. **Refactor large methods into smaller functions** (6 hours)
7. **Add comprehensive input validation** (4 hours)

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **What Works (Verified)**
- ✅ Screenshot capture (both tools)
- ✅ Baseline storage and metadata management  
- ✅ Model configuration loading and listing
- ✅ CLI argument parsing and validation
- ✅ Bedrock client initialization (fixed)

### **What Needs AWS Credentials (Cannot Test in Session)**
- ❌ AI-powered screenshot comparison
- ❌ Claude model communication
- ❌ Error handling for AWS-specific failures
- ❌ End-to-end `compare` command testing
- **⚠️ CONSTRAINT**: Cursor agent has no AWS access - focus on code-only optimizations

### **Test Commands Used**
```bash
# Model listing (works)
python screenshot_monitor.py list-models

# Baseline creation (works)  
python screenshot_monitor.py baseline https://example.com --name test

# Comparison (needs AWS credentials)
python screenshot_monitor.py compare https://example.com --name test
```

## 💡 **Key Insights & Discoveries**

1. **Bug Detection**: Static analysis revealed critical runtime bug that wasn't immediately obvious
2. **Configuration Benefits**: Moving to JSON dramatically improved maintainability
3. **Error Progression**: Proper error messages help distinguish between different failure modes
4. **Code Structure**: Large methods and duplicate code are primary maintenance burdens

## 🛠️ **Development Environment**

### **Technology Stack**
- Python 3.8+ with asyncio
- Playwright for browser automation  
- boto3 for AWS Bedrock integration
- pathlib, argparse, json for utilities

### **File Structure**
```

## 🔄 **Session Continuity Instructions**

### **For Next Session**
1. **Read this file first** to understand current state
2. **Check OPTIMIZATIONS.md** for remaining work
3. **Current priority**: Extract screenshot logic to shared module (1 hour task)
4. **Test approach**: Focus on code-only optimizations (no AWS required)
5. **⚠️ WORKFLOW**: Always create feature branch → PR → never push to main directly

### **Context Clues for AI Assistant**
- We've established trust through successful bug fixing
- User prefers incremental, tested changes
- Focus on high-impact, low-effort optimizations first
- Maintain detailed documentation for future reference
- **IMPORTANT**: Cursor agent cannot run AWS-dependent tests (no AWS credentials)
- **CRITICAL**: Never push changes directly to main branch - always use feature branches and PRs

### **Code Analysis Patterns**
- Look for unreachable code after return statements
- Identify memory usage inefficiencies
- Spot code duplication between modules
- Find overly complex methods that should be split

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Completed Metrics**
- ✅ Critical functionality restored (AI comparison works)
- ✅ Configuration externalized and validated
- ✅ Comprehensive optimization roadmap created
- ✅ Development context preserved
- ✅ Model configuration caching implemented (6.2x performance improvement)
- ✅ Professional Git workflow established (branch → PR → merge)

### **Next Targets**
- 🎯 Reduce memory usage during image processing
- 🎯 Eliminate code duplication between tools
- 🎯 Improve error handling and user experience
- 🎯 Add proper logging for debugging

## 🗂️ **Reference Information**

### **Important Line Numbers (as of last session)**
- `screenshot_monitor.py:70-80` - Bedrock client initialization (fixed)
- `screenshot_monitor.py:170-370` - `compare_with_claude()` method (needs refactoring)
- `screenshot_monitor.py:440-540` - `generate_report()` method (needs refactoring)

### **Key Files to Monitor**
- Any changes to model configuration should update `models.json`
- Major architectural changes should update this context file
- New optimizations should be tracked in `OPTIMIZATIONS.md`
